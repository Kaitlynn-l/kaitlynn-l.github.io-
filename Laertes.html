        <h1> Laertes</h1>
        <p> Lairtes and Ophelia have a very unique dynamic. They are close, but Laertes acts more as a boss to Ophelia
            than a friend, which is usually the role siblings play. </p>
        <h2> Examples</h2>
        <h3> Act 1</h3>
        <div class="quotation">
            <blockquote> I shall the effect of this good lesson keep, as watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
                do not, as some ungracious pastors do, show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, whiles, like a
                puffed and reckless libertine, himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, and recks not his own
                rede. </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (1.3.34-36) </p>
        </div>
        <p> This quote demonstrates the awkwardness in Laertes and Ophelia's relationship, because it shows just how
            bossy and hypocritical he is when he advises her. He tells her to stay away from Hamlet, and is
            metalling in her afairs, but when he explains it to her, it comes off more like an order, hense why
            Ophelia reacted this way. We can still see a bit of closeness though, as she refers to him as, "Good my
            brother." This comes across as an endearing term.</p>
        <h3> Act 4 </h3>
        <div class="quotation">
            <blockquote> O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
                By heaven, thy madness shall be paid with weight,
                Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May, dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! O heavens, is’t
                possible a young maid’s wits should be as mortal as an old man’s life?</blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (4.5.95-97) </p>
        </div>
        <p> This quote is what really demonstrates Ophelia and Laertes' closeness. When Laertes sees Ophelia's
            state, he goes into a state of pure rage. Despite the way society makes him treat Ophelia, we can still
            see his unwavoring efection for her.</p>
