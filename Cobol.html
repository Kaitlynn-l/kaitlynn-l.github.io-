<h1> Cobol</h1>

Cobol was designed to be business oriented, as there were no languages designed with that purpose in mind at the time. It was also the first language that had english-like syntax to become mainstream. Cobol can currantly be found in ATM and phone systems, as well as in legacy computer programs. </p>
