        <p> Ophelia has three main relationships throughout the play. Her brother Laertes, her father Polonius, and her
            former boyfriend Hamlet. Due to the time period, she was expected to be obediant to all of the men in her
            life. This eventually lead her to disend into madness. Click on the buttons below to learn more about her
            relationship to each of these men. </p>
