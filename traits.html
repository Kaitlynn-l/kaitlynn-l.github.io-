        <h1> Traits </h1>
        <p> Due to the time in which Ophelia's character was brought to life, she wasn't given the same degree of
            development as most of the other characters. Plays were written primarily for men, so Shakespeare had to
            create a female character that men could fully embrace at that time. It seems as though Shakespeare wrote
            her to teach men that their unwavering expectations at the time were unrealistic, due to what happened to
            her at the end of the play.<br>
            Ophelia is known for being extremely submissive and obediant. The few times she does stick up for herself,
            it results in her caving and eventually agreeing with whatever it is people tell her. <br>
            Throughout the story, we see her fluctuate between devotion for her father and brother to devotion to
            Hamlet. Trying to pick sides eventually resulted in Ophelia's downfall.</p>
        <h2> Examples </h2>
        <h3> act 1 </h3>
        <div class="quotation">
            <blockquote> ’Tis in my memory locked,And you yourself shall keep the key of it. </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (1.3.55) </p>
        </div>
        <p> This shows Ophelia's submissiveness because he politely tries to defend
            her right to see him before this portion, only to cave into lairtes' demands. </p>
        <h3> Act 3 </h3>
        <div class="quotation">
            <blockquote> Read on this book, that show of such an exercise may color your loneliness. We are oft to blame
                in this: ’Tis too much proved that with devotion’s visage and pious action we do sugar o’er the devil
                himself. </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (3.1.30-33) </p>
        </div>
        <p> This quote shows just how obediant Ophelia is, because she is willing to spy on Hamlet for her father, but
            she does not want to hurt him, therefore, she is obeying both by complying with her father's wish for her to
            spy on Hamlet.</p>
        <h3> Act 4 </h3>
        <div class="quotation">
            <blockquote> Larded with sweet flowers which bewept to the grave did [not] go with true-love showers.
            </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (4.5.24) </p>
        </div>
        <p> This quote shows how Ophelia's obediant nature ultimately lead to her demise. She was attempting to please
            both Hamlet and her father, however, they both left her. Now all on her own, she has no one to follow,
            ultimately leading to her loss of self-worth.</p>
