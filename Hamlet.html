        <h1> Hamlet </h1>
        <p> Hamlet is Ophelia's boyfriend. The relationship seems to be extremely one-sided. Hamlet never seems to
            express any true forms of love for Ophelia.</p>
        <h2> Examples </h2>
        <h3> Act 1 </h3>
        <div class="" quotation">
            <blockquote> He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me. </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (1.3.34-36) </p>
        </div>
        <p> This quote shows just how fond Ophelia was of Hamlet. She felt open enough to express it to her father,
            which, despite her obediant personality, is still quite significant.</p>
        <h3> Act 3</h3>
        <div class="" quotation">
            <blockquote> Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (3.1.115) </p>
        </div>
        <p> This quote shows Hamlet's true feelings towards Ophelia. He implies she should never mary, or have kids.
            Which implies he doesn't truely love her, and he was only involved in the relationship for his own perpose
            due to saying this once their relationship technically ended.</p>
        <h3> Act 4 </h3>
        <div class="" quotation">
            <blockquote> By Gis and by Saint Charity,, Alack, and fie, for shame!! Young men will do ’t, if they come to
                ’t. By
                Cock, they are to blame. </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (4.5.37)</p>
        </div>
        <p> This quote demonstrates Ophelia's feelings for Hamlet once their relationship ended and she went mad. She is
            expressing the fact that it seems as though Hamlet only wanted her for sex. She also seems to think that
            most men are like this, because she says "They are, " rather than "He is."</p>
