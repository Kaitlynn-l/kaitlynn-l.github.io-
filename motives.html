        <h1> Motives</h1>
        <p> Ophelia is neither a protagonist or antagonist. Therefore, she is neither passive, nor agressive in the
            story. She is set up to be a blank slate, with only her devotion to others as forms of self worth. </p>
        <h2> Examples </h2>
        <p> A lot of these examples cannot be seen through longer phrases Ophelia has spoken, rather, they can be ffound
            in her general speach patterns. For example, we see her say "My Lord," several times throughout the play,
            and call people things like, "Good my brother," Shakespeare (1.3) and "the beauteous majesty of Denmark."
            Shakespeare (4.5) These demonstrate that she is a character whoes only motive is to please. <br>
            There would be more examples, however, Ophelia rarely refers to her intentions, rather showing them through
            her actions, which have already been expressed elsewhere.</p>
