    <h1> Polonius </h1>
    <p> Due to how quickly Polonius is killed, we don't get to see very much of Ophelia and Polonius's relationship. It
      seems as though they are close, though not as close as Laertes and Ophelia were. <br>
      Sometimes, it comes off as though Polonius genuinely cares about Ophelia. Others it seems like he is just trying
      to control her.</p>
    <h2> Examples</h2>
    <h3> Act 1</h3>
    <div class="quotation">
      <blockquote> Affection! pooh! You speak like a green girl, Unsiftedd in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe
        his tenders, as you call them?</blockquote>
      <p> Shakespeare (1.3.101)</p>
    </div>
    <P> In this quote, you can clearly see that Polonius is speaking to Ophelia in an extremely erigant manner. He
      called her a "green girl," which means an uninteligent girl. It almost comes off as though he is advising her, but
      also attempting to control her. </p>
    <h3> Act 2 </h3>
    <div class="quotation">
      <blockquote>I feared he did but trifle,
        and meant to wrack thee â€“ but beshrew my jealousy! By heaven, it is as proper to our age to cast beyond
        ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion.</blockquote>
      <p> Shakespeare (2.1.65) </p>
    </div>
    <p> Despite Polonius's arrogance, this quote demonstrates the side of him that truely does care for Ophelia. He
      seems to be apologizing for the erigant way he acted earlier, however, one could question whether this apology is
      genuine or not. </p>
    <h3> Act 4 </h3>
    <div class="quotation">
      <blockquote> He is dead and gone, lady, he is dead and gone, at his head a grass-green turf, at his heels a stone.
        Oh, ho! </blockquote>
      <p> Shakespeare(4.5.25)</p>
    </div>
    <p> In this quote, we can see just how much Polonius's death affected Ophelia. It has shaken her to the point of
      insanity, which proves either how close they were, or how lost she was without his control. There is enough
      evidence to support both claims. </p>
