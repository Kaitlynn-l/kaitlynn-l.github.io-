        <h1> Impact on plot </h1>
        <p> At first glance, Ophelia's role in Hamlet's plot is unclear. However, many people say her role is to be an
            easy way for Hamlet and Polonius to get what they want. </p>
        <h2> examples </h2>
        <h3> Act 1 </h3>
        <div class="" quotation">
            <blockquote>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his
                saying deed, which is no further than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your
                honor may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs, or lose your heart, or your chaste
                treasure open to his unmastered importunity. Fear it, Ophelia. Fear it, my dear sister, and keep you in
                the rear of your affection, out of the shot and danger of desire. </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (25-36) </p>
        </div>
        <p> This quote demonstrates other characters' suspitions of Hamlet. Laertes warns Ophelia about him, however, we
            don't directly see it from Hamlet yet. </p>
        <h3> Act 2 </h3>
        <div class="" quotation">
            <blockquote> • My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; No hat
                upon his head; his stockings fouled,
                Ungartered, and down-gyvèd to his ankle; Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
                And with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosèd out of hell to speak of horrors— he comes
                before me. </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (2.1.79-84)</p>
        </div>
        <p> This quote is proof that Hamlet is using Ophelia. Rather than speaking to her, he stares at her, with
            clothes either dirty or half off. That gives the idea that he is using her for sex.</p>
        <h3> Act 3 </h3>
        <div class="" quotation">
            <blockquote> Sweet Gertrude, leave us too, for we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, that he, as ’twere by
                accident, may here affront Ophelia. Her father and myself (lawful espials) Will so bestow ourselves
                that, seeing unseen, we may of their encounter frankly judge, and gather by him, as he is behaved, If ’t
                be the affliction of his love or That thus he suffers for. </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare ((3.1.29)) </p>
        </div>
        <p> This quote demonstrates how Polonius is using Ophelia for Claudius's needs. Claudius is technically
            Polonius's boss, therefore, Ophelia is helping Polonius fullfill duties in his occupation. </p>
        <hr>
        <p> The other thing Ophelia is used for is demonstrating the unfairness in Elizabethan society. If people were
            remotely different from the normal, Christian values, you were considered less than.</p>
        <h2> Example </h2>
        <div class="quotation">
            <blockquote> Give me leave. Here lies the water. Good. Here stands the man. Good. If the man go to this
                water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he goes. Mark you that. But if the water come to him
                and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own
                life. </blockquote>
            <p> Shakespeare (5.1.20) </p>
        </div>
        <p> The reason this quote demonstrates this is because of the fact they are talking about Ophelia's death as if
            it is less of a tragity because her death was a suicide.</p>
